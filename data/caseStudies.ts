The WA’s purpose is to help all customers which request assistance while visiting (browsing through the website. The WA will manage new customers and members accordingly. Meaning that it will use previous information on members to better serve and assist them, while gathering the proper information from the new customers. To achieve this, the WA has been trained to orient the customers through the website, answer all of the customers questions concerning the website, it’s services and the products as of how to use them, their features, their guarantees, cost, financing, shipping, return policies, payments etc. To begin, a character is created, a woman/girl, man/boy or any other fictional character. Then a digital voice is selected (or created) and attributed to the character. The character will either be voice only, text only or have a 2D/3D appearance. In the case that it is visible, it will have a set of dedicated corporeal and facial animations in sync with the moods. Once the character is created, it is then trained with the set of skills and knowhow it will need to play it’s role of WA according to the website that it is designated for.',
